## Installation

    $ cd ~
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/barvian/dotfiles.git
    $ git pull origin master
    $ ~/scripts/bootstrap

## Stuff To Change

**Please change the `.gitconfig` so you don't commit everything as me.** Everything else shouldn't need tweaking.

Enjoy.
